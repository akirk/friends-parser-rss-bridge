## Description

This parser is powered by the open source project [RSS Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) (resp. a very similar fork at [akirk/rss-bridge](https://github.com/akirk/rss-bridge)) and allows to parse many external services that don't provide RSS feeds, such as Skimfeed, Twitter, Bandcamp, Wikipedia and more.

The RSS Bridge project provides a set of "bridges" that overcome the gap between web sites' content and a machine readable format, such as RSS. This plugin extends the bridge into the WordPress world, especially to the [Friends Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/friends) which can then be used to follow your friends on platforms that don't provide RSS feeds, or some news sites.

This plugin is meant to be used with the [Friends plugin](https://github.com/akirk/friends/).
